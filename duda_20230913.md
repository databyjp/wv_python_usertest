Uses ipython
asked why we have wvc.Property instead of an untyped dict 
not sure about wvc as name
was expecting to use 'Property' and choose ref under datatype
could target_property accept Collection object as target
Ran `articles.query.get()` immediately
Asked why we have `return_properties` and not `properties` under get
Looked for BM25 under get
Mentioned `query__title` type syntax
LinkTo still quite challenging - could it be `wroteArticle__title`?
Looked under objects[0].generative -> thinks it shoudl be here 
Looked at the same place for grouped task once he saw the results
asked where is build / graphql?

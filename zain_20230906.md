Notes:

- Immediately went to Jupyter
- Commented on liking vectorizer config class
- Accidentally connected to a wrong instance (previously running); did not indicate gRPC not running; maybe we could send a dummy reequest or something?
- Easily able to create a new `author` class from seeing one.
  - Jupyter intellisense mixes in Enums with method
- Wanted to add vector index config
- Noticed there are lots of classes in `wvc`
- Went straight past VectorIndexConfigCreate -> should be VectorIndexConfig
- Looked for "Distance" rather than "VectorDistance" for the Enum - basically scrolled through the whole set
- Interestingly tried to use VectorDistance as a function first (Distance? DistanceMetric?)
- Was confused with unclear type hint while creating an object (what is ~property? not clear in Jupyter)
- Tried to instantiate a TypedDict object with a series of values
    - Jupyter did not give type hints for TypeDict
- Forgot to specify `return_properties` initially
    - Commented on wanting to get all objects back unless told otherwise ;)
- Tried to use MetadataQuery like a method (MetadataQuery.xxx)
    - Initially tried to set `return_metadata=True`
- Surprised to find `vector`, `distance` to be metadata 
    - Considered whether something was 'central' 
- Got multiple objects - and wanted to try res[:].properties
- Prefer flat as a first impression
    - Found the options version quite verbose 
Took 
```python
response = articles.query.get_options(
    options=wvc.GetOptions(limit=1),
    returns=wvc.ReturnValues(
        properties=["title", "body"],
        metadata=wvc.MetadataQuery(
            uuid=True
        )
    ),
)
```

And flattened it out like

```python
response = articles.query.get_options(
    options=wvc.GetOptions(limit=1),
    returns=wvc.ReturnValues(properties=["title", "body"],metadata=wvc.MetadataQuery(uuid=True)),
)
```

Gave Zain an example `get_options` query and asked to create a `bm25_options`. 
Tried to use `GetOptions` class

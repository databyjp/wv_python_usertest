tried to run results.xxx rather than results[0].xxx

generative - confused by param name
liked grouped task
not sure about combined results -> per object and grouped task?

should it be results.objects in all cases, including when not

looks for consistency in objects

get needs a filter

Could have delete_by_id vs delete

authors.data
Delete class? Hidden method? __delete?

maybe put `generate` inside each search?





asked me to use `client.collection.get("Article")` to run tests
